# A Snazzy Yet Swift Particle Engine
![](res/enginelogo2.png?raw=true "Engine Logo") 

## Synopsis
For the last year I've been working on a Particle Engine written in Java; a program for people who like to explore and create, for people who like to experiment, for education, and most importantly for having fun. It's been one of the most fun things I've done and I've learned so much and I couldn't be more proud of sticking with an idea which I didn't think at first was possible. I'm incredibly happy to be able to share this with you all! Thank you to everyone who has and continues to support me!

## Prerequisities

What you'll need to build your own version or to run the program

### Project Development / Setup (Using Source Code):
```
Java JDK 8 + Java JRE 8 - Minimum due to use of lambda functions
Any text editor of your choice
```
Editors I highly recommend: 
[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) --
[Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/) --
[Atom](https://atom.io/) --
[Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)


### Running the Program (Jar file):
```
Java JRE 8 - Minimum due to use of lambda functions
```

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes! :D

### Checking for Java

In order to both run and create your own projects you need to hava Java installed. Here's how to check on each system (Windows, Mac, or Linux)

### Step 1:

#### Windows:

Open Command Prompt: ```(Windows key + r)```, then type in the text field  ```cmd``` and press enter.

#### Mac:

Open Terminal: ```(Apple key + space-bar)```, then type in ```Terminal``` and when the Terminal Icon appears press enter.

#### Linux: 

Open Terminal (if running Ubuntu or Linux Mint): Keyboard shortcut = ```(Ctrl+Alt+T)```


### Step 2:

Once either command prompt or terminal windows are open on your respective system(s), enter this command:
```

```
and then press enter.

## Closing Comments
If you've stuck with reading up to this point I highly appreciate it! I'll keep this short. This project is officially Open Source! 
I'll be pushing updates to this Engine as I can, and feel free to fork or port this to other languages! I'd love to see your creations,
be as creative as possible and let no one discourage you from having fun!
