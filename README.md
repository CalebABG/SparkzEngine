-------------------------------------------------------

## Synopsis
For the last year I've been working on a Particle Engine written in Java; a program for people who like to explore and create, for people who like to experiment, for education, and most importantly for having fun. It's been one of the most fun things I've done and I've learned so much and I couldn't be more proud of sticking with an idea which I didn't think at first was possible. I'm incredibly happy to be able to share this with you all! Thank you to everyone who has and continues to support me!

## Prerequisities

What you'll need to build your own fork or to run the program

### Forking:
```
Java JDK 8 + Java JRE 8 - Minimum due to use of lambda functions
Any text editor of your choice

Editors I highly recommend: 
[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) --
[Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/) --
[Atom](https://atom.io/) --
[Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)


### Running the jar:
```
Give examples
```

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```

## Closing Comments
If you've stuck with reading up to this point I highly appreciate it! I'll keep this short. This project is officially Open Source! 
I'll be pushing updates to this Engine as I can, and feel free to fork or port this to other languages! I'd love to see your creations,
be as creative as possible and let no one discourage you from having fun!
